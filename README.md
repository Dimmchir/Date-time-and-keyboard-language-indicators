The application will be useful for those who want to see information about the current language layout of the keyboard or about the Date / Time anywhere on the desktop and of any size.<br>

The indicators can work together or one by one. To turn off any indicator, select "Delete indicator" in the context menu. In this case, the indicator does not load and does not use the resources of the operating system. The deleted indicator can be returned at any time by selecting "Add indicator" in the context menu of the running indicator.<br>

Using the context menu, the Date / Time Indicator can switch to several formats - full date and time, shortened date and time, hours / minutes, and hours / minutes / seconds. The user can choose the color of the characters and background at will. The background can be made transparent.<br>

The keyboard layout indicator works normally, provided that the system has only two layouts - Latin and any other.<br>
At the first launch, you will be asked to calibrate the layout. In the window that appears, you need to enter any letter in the Latin layout
The flag images can be changed to any others using the context menu of the flag indicator.<br>

In the future, if the language layout in the system has changed, you need to re-calibrate using the context menu of the flag indicator.<br>
Since the program runs in the background and makes frequent requests to the system when determining the current time and keyboard layout, antiviruses and defenders give a false positive message about the presence of a virus. There are no viruses.<br>
